In my first project I worked on building a so-called Micromouse. This vehicle can autonomously solve a maze which consists of 180mm x 180mm squares. 
The goal is to solve the maze as fast as possible. However, my goal of the project was to simply create a working Micromouse that can detect walls and avoid them.
 

### The outcome
The outcome of this project can be seen in this small video:

Here i tried to reconstructed the dimension of Micromouse maze using books. Several things can be noted. First of all, the vehicle is able to detect the walls of the maze and successfully perform a left turn.
This is great news! Secondely the vehicle is rather slow and the motors are quite loud. During the video, the micromouse is running at 20 rpm which is around one-third of the max speed so there is still room for improvement.
